# DIPCP - Decentralized Intellectual Property Collaboration Platform

[中文说明](README_zh-CN.md)

## Project Introduction

DIPCP is a decentralized IP collaboration platform operated by the DIPCF Foundation and based on GitHub. It aims to provide content management and collaboration features for IP creators worldwide.
However, the value of this platform goes far beyond this. It has successfully explored a viable path for operating network projects with zero cost without the need to set up your own server. Those in need can modify it on this basis to create applications suitable for themselves.

## Core Features

- 🏠 **No Server Required**: Fully static JS pages, directly deployed on GitHub Pages, with zero operational costs
- 🔄 **GitHub Integration**: Based on GitHub's plain text storage and version management
- ✏️ **Offline Editing**: Supports offline editing and creating new pages
- 🌿 **Auto Branching**: Automatic branch creation, local caching, and submission review
- 👥 **Review Mechanism**: Professional content review team responsible for merge decisions
- 🏆 **Points System**: Contribution-based points reward mechanism
- 👤 **User Management**: Group authorization and permission control
- ⚡ **Native JavaScript**: Developed with native JS, simple and easy to debug

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+ (for development server)
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Git (for version control)

### Start Development Environment

1. **Windows Users**:
  ```
  Copy the start-dev.bat and start-dev.py file to the parent directory of DIPCP (in order to create the same directory structure as on GitHub).  
  Run the start-dev.bat file located in the parent directory.   
  ```

2. **Access Application**:
   ```
   Open in browser: http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Development Notes

- **No Node.js Required**: The project uses a single-page native JavaScript architecture, no npm or Node.js needed
- **Easy Debugging**: Simply modify HTML/CSS/JS files, browser auto-refreshes
- **Modular Design**: Each page is a functionally independent JS file, easy to maintain

### Essential Reading for Users

- **Access to GitHub**: This is a necessary condition
- **Register Account**: Register a GitHub account using email or Google/Apple accounts
- **Generate Personal Access Token**: Visit (https://github.com/settings/tokens), generate a "Generate new token (classic)" token, set the expiration to never, select all permissions, and save it after generation
