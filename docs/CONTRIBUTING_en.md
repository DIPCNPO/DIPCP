# Contributing to DIPCP

Thank you for considering contributing to the DIPCP project!
We believe that **“only collective wisdom can create masterpieces that stand the test of time.”**
By providing a permanent, collaborative ecosystem, DIPCP enables writers and creators from around the world to achieve goals that are impossible with individual effort alone.
Within this ecosystem, individual imagination is amplified by collective intelligence, making it possible to create exceptional intellectual property.

## Our Philosophy

* **Market Autonomy:** The value of content is determined by the community through **reference count** and **net likes**, rather than by any committee or subjective judgment.
* **Forking as Rights:** Contributors must accept that their creations within an **adopted path** may be **modified, terminated, or removed**, and they have no right to stop such actions.
* **Profit Based on Market Recognition:** Readers vote on each article using **like**, **dislike**, or **skip**. Authors may reference each other’s articles. During commercialization, revenue share for each author is determined by the article’s **valid word count**, **reference count**, and **net likes**.

### Core Principles

**【Absolute Premise】** All contributors must sign the **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** and **irrevocably** declare:

1. **Permanent License:** All content is permanently and irrevocably licensed to DIPCNPO (Decentralized IP Collaboration Non-Profit Organization), which is responsible for unified commercial operations.
2. **Fate Waiver:** Contributors accept that characters, settings, or storylines they create may be **modified or terminated** by future authors within the **adopted path**, and they waive all control over the character’s **“right to survival”** and **“ultimate fate.”**

## What Makes Good Creative Work?

Every article should add value to collaborative storytelling.
Ask yourself: **“Does this make the story more interesting?”**

**✅ Good contributions:**

* Filling missing content
* Fixing typos
* More engaging storytelling
* Richer plot development
* Translations into other languages

**❌ Not acceptable contributions:**

* Insulting or attacking other contributors
* Content that contradicts the established worldbuilding

## Important Rules

1. If you want to quote large sections of another author’s article, the quoted part must be wrapped in **[] square brackets**, followed by **() parentheses** containing the path to the original text.
2. The path format is:
   **(Author/Work/Directory/File)**
3. If you do not indicate quotes properly, your content will be considered plagiarism. During commercialization review, the entire article will be rejected and will not be eligible for payment.
4. If your content plagiarizes other works, your article will not be eligible for any compensation during commercialization review, and you may also face legal action.
5. Your article can only become visible to readers—and therefore gain commercial value—when it is referenced by others.

**Remember:** Every great writer was once a beginner.
Let’s work together to create stories that will be remembered for generations.
