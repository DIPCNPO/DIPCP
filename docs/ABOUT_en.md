# **Project Introduction: DIPCP – Decentralized Intellectual Property Collaboration Platform**

## **1. Project Positioning and Vision**

### **1.1. Organization Entity: DIPCNPO (Decentralized Intellectual Property Collaboration Non-Profit Organization)**

* **Nature:** A non-profit legal entity established in Singapore.
* **Mission:** To centrally manage decentralized intellectual property (IP) and provide a stable, legally sound, and permanently free collaboration environment for global creators.
* **Vision:** To empower global creators to collaboratively produce great intellectual property works that can be passed down through generations through the power of collaboration.

### **1.2. Core Platform: DIPCP**

DIPCP is a decentralized collaboration platform based on **GitHub Pages**, fundamentally addressing the pain points of traditional collaboration models: **high costs, ambiguous IP ownership, and centralized censorship**. The platform employs a **"data as the judge"** incentive mechanism, encouraging creators to incubate IP value through forking, referencing, and market recognition.

## **2. Disruptive Technology and Operational Architecture**

The DIPCF Foundation utilizes minimalism and distributed technology to build an unprecedented zero-cost operational model, committing to ultimate transparency and user experience.

### **2.1. Zero-Cost, Permanently Free Serverless Architecture**

* **Technical Foundation:** The platform directly utilizes **GitHub Pages** to serve all users, **without building or maintaining its own servers**.
* **Cost Advantage:** Operating costs approach zero. The platform can promise users **permanent free use**, requiring only a GitHub account to join.
* **Decentralization Advantage:** Adopting a decentralized distributed architecture ensures that even if GitHub ceases operations, all content is stored in users' local repositories, can be exported anytime, and community operations can be quickly restored, safeguarding the persistence of IP assets.

### **2.2. Commitment to Transparency and Optimal User Experience**

* **Code Transparency:** All platform code will be **completely open-source** to ensure **absolute transparency** and fairness in platform operations, guaranteeing no hidden logic or backdoors.
* **Optimal Reading Experience:** The platform promises to **never display advertisements**, providing creators and readers with a pure, distraction-free creation and reading environment, ensuring the best user experience.

### **2.3. Legal and IP Asset Management**

* **CLA Management:** The Foundation is responsible for managing the signing of the [CLA](CLA.md) (Contributor License Agreement) and stores the agreements in private repositories to protect author privacy.
* **Unified IP Management:** Through the CLA, the Foundation **centrally obtains unified management and usage rights for all IP**, providing a legal foundation for subsequent commercialization.
* **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0:** All work repositories use this license, ensuring only the Foundation can conduct commercial development.
    - Creative Commons (CC): Intellectual property is shared.
    - Attribution (BY): Any user must provide attribution.
    - NonCommercial (NC): Anyone can create derivative works based on this IP (e.g., write fan fiction, draw fan art), but not for commercial purposes.
    - ShareAlike (SA): If others create new works based on this work, they must share them under the same [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](LICENSE.md) license.

### **2.4. Transparent Non-Profit Financial Model**

* **Funding Sources:** Primarily maintained through a small portion of revenue retained from project commercialization or legal compensation from rights protection, as well as community donations.
* **Reward Mechanism:** Retained surplus funds **will not be used for dividends** but will serve as a **reward fund**. Based on nominations by respective project councils and community-wide voting, rewards are distributed to selected outstanding creators according to ranking.
* **Donation Management:** Designated donations are fully transferred to the specified project council; non-designated donations are accounted for uniformly, with surplus distributed according to the reward mechanism.

## **3. Core Value Proposition for Creators**

The DIPCP platform offers creators six core advantages unparalleled by traditional platforms, driving the transition from **"solo creation"** to **"collective co-creation"**.

| Advantage | Core Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. The Power of Collective Co-Creation** | **Collaboration Empowerment** | Break free from the limitations of working alone and create collectively through team strength. Collaboratively produced works can satisfy broader reader tastes and have greater potential to endure. |
| **2. Cost and Barrier Advantages** | **Zero-Cost Collaboration** | Solves the issues traditional platforms face in coordinating IP ownership and high platform setup costs. Users can join global collaboration with zero investment and no cost. |
| **3. Unregulated Creative Freedom** | **Unleashed Imagination** | The platform imposes no official restrictions on creative content, allowing creators to fully unleash their imagination, create multiverses, and stimulate content vitality. |
| **4. Efficient Commercial Realization** | **Market-Driven** | Through data such as **citation counts and net positive votes**, outstanding works will not be buried. The market clearly identifies value, making commercial realization direct and efficient. |
| **5. Blurred Author Boundaries** | **Largest-Scale Community** | Blurs the line between authors and readers, forming a globally unique, largest-scale free cultural creation community. |
| **6. Minimal Technical Barriers** | **Global Usability** | Does not use complex blockchain technology or issue tokens (no "rug pulls"), significantly lowering barriers to global collaboration and legal risks. |

## **4. Governance and Commercialization Process**

The governance structure of this system is **council-led strategy with foundation support**.

### **4.1. IP Value Realization Mechanism**

* **Operational Process:** Only when the **council** of a respective project (e.g., a specific IP universe) submits a **formal written request** to the Foundation will the Foundation assist them in completing commercialization operations (e.g., selling movie/game rights) or legal rights protection.
* **Revenue Distribution:** After successful operation, the Foundation retains a small portion of revenue or compensation as operational costs; **the vast majority** of revenue is distributed to creators according to the allocation method agreed upon by the project council (i.e., the data formulas in the **[Multiverse Fork Incentive Model White Paper](White_Paper_V2.1.md)**).

### **4.2. Governance Division of Responsibilities**

| Entity | Core Functions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Project Council (Council)** | **The highest decision-making body for a project.** Responsible for deciding commercialization paths, setting revenue distribution weights (determined by creator vote), and maintaining basic community norms. |
| **DIPCNPO** | **Legal and Administrative Support Layer.** Responsible for CLA signing, unified IP management, commercialization delegation, legal rights protection assistance, fund distribution, and reward fund management. |
