# **"White Paper on the Multiverse Forking Incentive Model (V2.1)"**

## **0. Introduction: Core Philosophy and Legal Foundation**

This white paper aims to provide a new incentive and revenue distribution framework based on **GitHub + P2P** for decentralized, open-source content creation projects, utilizing **data as the arbiter**. This system ensures **extreme openness, transparency, and fairness** in content. This model operates entirely in accordance with, and is constrained by, the provisions of the **DIPCNPO Charter**.

### **0.1 Core Philosophy**

* **Market Autonomy:** The value of content is determined by the community's **citation count** and **net likes**, not by subjective evaluation from any committee or individual.
* **Forking as Rights:** Contributors must accept that their creations may be **modified, terminated, or removed** within an **adopted path**, and they have no right to prevent this.
* **Legal Outsourcing:** This system does not undertake the responsibility of arbitrating disputes in the legal domain such as **plagiarism or malicious destruction**. Such disputes are to be resolved entirely by the **aggrieved party** through legal channels.

### **0.2 Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**

**【Absolute Prerequisite】** All contributors must sign the **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** and **irrevocably** declare the following:

1.  **Permanent License:** All content is permanently and irrevocably licensed to DIPCNPO for use.
2.  **Abandonment of Destiny:** Contributors must accept that the role, setting, or plot of their creation **can be modified or terminated by subsequent authors** in an **adopted path**, and they waive the control over the character's **"right to exist" and "final destiny."**

## **1. Core Architecture: The Multiverse Forking Model**

This model is based on the distributed version control characteristics of **GitHub + P2P**, where every work is a mesh structure that can be infinitely forked and cross-referenced.

### **1.1 Content Creation**

1.  **Creation Method:** Creators create a work repository with the same name as the original author on their own devices and create and update content within it.
2.  **Content Independence:** Each creator's content is a self-consistent **"parallel universe"** or a part of it, interacting with content in other identically named work repositories through file links.
3.  **Author Responsibility:** Creators must guarantee the originality of the content. If infringement is discovered, all legal responsibility shall be borne by the creator. For images created by the author, regardless of content or size, each image is calculated as 100 words. Similarly, for music created by the author, regardless of length, each segment is calculated as 100 words. Video content is not currently supported.
4.  **File Format:** Text files only support the md format, image files only support the jpg and png formats, and audio files only support the mp3 format.
5.  **Reader Rights:** Everyone is both an author and a reader. When reading others' works, they have the right to **like**, **dislike**, and **pass by**. To avoid influencing the reader's subjective judgment, they cannot see the voting results of other readers for the content; only the author can see them, but the author cannot vote. Since the author has the right to modify already published content, there is no guarantee that users will see the same content every time they enter the same page, and thus readers can change their opinion at any time. Readers can also trace and view all historical versions of the files.

### **1.2 Content Citation and Value Anchoring**

* **Unique File Name:** All content fragments (including but not limited to: story chapters, images, audio, or the definition of characters, scenes, props, species, magic, martial arts, sects, units, laws, phenomena, and beliefs) must be stored in independent files, and files can link to other files.
* **Explicit Citation:** Authors, when creating, **explicitly cite** files within their own or other authors' branches through **file links**, forming a mesh structure. If an author wants to add a citation to their own file within the original author's file, they must submit a request to the original author, who can agree or refuse. The citation format in an md file is `[text](version number/username/work/path/filename.extension)`, and the version number can be omitted, defaulting to the latest version.
* **Value Definition:** The value of content is not determined by human intervention but by the following **three objective data points**: **effective word count in the adopted path, citation count, and net likes**.

## **2. Incentives and Revenue Calculation**

A contributor's eligibility for and weight in the allocation from the **Creator Subsidy Fund** are determined entirely based on the **objective data generated by the content in the commercially adopted path**.

### **2.1 Contribution Score Formula**

A contributor's total score (i.e., revenue allocation weight) is calculated by weighting the following **three core data metrics**:

Contribution Score = Sum of scores for all files in the path

Single File Score = (Word Count Weight * Base Word Count Score + Citation Weight * Citation Count) * (Net Like Value of This File / Net Like Value of All Files)

| Metric | Represents Value | Calculation Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Word Count Score** | **Effort Invested (Volume)** | The total effective new word count contributed by the contributor **in the final adopted commercialization path**. |
| **Citation Count** | **Content's Foundational Nature (Utility)** | The total number of times the contributor's content has been **effectively cited by other authors in the final adopted commercialization path**. |
| **Net Like Value** | **Community Preference (Quality)** | The **Net Likes** (Likes - Dislikes) gained by the contributor's content **in the final adopted commercialization path**. |

### **2.2 Determination of Dynamic Weights**

**The Creation Council negotiates and votes to determine the weights during commercialization.**

1.  **Negotiation:** All authors involved in this revenue allocation (i.e., all authors whose content is in the adopted path) first engage in negotiation to propose their suggested weights.
2.  **Voting:** The final weights are determined by a vote among **all authors participating in this subsidy allocation** to achieve **beneficiary autonomy**.

### **2.3 Commercialization Scenarios and Allocation**

Subsidy allocation is based on the **actual content path adopted by the commercialized product**:
Assume a work involves four creators: A, B, C, and D.

1.  **Linear Product (e.g., Movie):** Only the contribution scores of all authors in the **final adopted, linear** path (e.g., A C D path) are calculated.
2.  **Open Product (e.g., Open-World Game):** The contribution scores of **all contributors included in the product** (A, B, C, D) are calculated.

## **3. Governance and Legal Boundaries**

This model adopts a structure of **minimalist autonomy**, establishing a **Platform Council** and a **Creation Council** as the bodies for work management and strategic decision-making.

### **3.1 Core Functions of the Platform Council**

1.  Focuses solely on **commercialization strategy and IP legal risks**, formulates the white paper, develops and upgrades the DIPCP, and fulfills fiduciary duties.
2.  Unified management of the CLA.
3.  **IP Legal Risk Transfer:** The Platform Council **does not** conduct determination of plagiarism or copyright conflicts. If such legal issues arise, the Platform Council is responsible for **formally recording the report information and informing the parties involved**, but does not participate in legal arbitration or enforcement, leaving it entirely to **external legal procedures** for resolution.
4.  **Final Authority on Content Regulation:** According to Article 7C of the DIPCNPO Charter, the Platform Council (Board of Directors) holds the final authority, upon gaining a 75% absolute majority vote, to remove content reasonably deemed to fall under "Prohibited Uses" (such as inciting violence, exploitative content, etc.) to protect the legal existence of the platform and DIPCNPO.
5.  Distributes subsidies from the **Creator Subsidy Fund** to nominated authors, according to the results of the Project Council's negotiation and voting.

### **3.2 Core Functions of the Creation Council**

1.  **Commercialization Path Decision:** The Creation Council is the sole authority with the power to decide how to commercialize and which forking path to adopt for commercialization.
2.  **Subsidy Nomination and Voting Organization:** The Creation Council nominates high-value creators for eligibility for the **Creator Subsidy Fund** based on contribution scores and community influence. After council members negotiate the ratio of the 2 weights, a vote must be initiated, and all authors in the effective path can participate in the voting. The final subsidy recipients and allocation amounts are determined by a community vote within the scope of the project.

## **4. Application Examples**

### 4.1 Basic Algorithm
1. Assume Author A, as the initiator, wrote a work about the **Xuanyuan Dynasty**. It includes two characters, **Zhang San** and **Li Si**. Three files need to be created for these three definitions. **Xuanyuan Dynasty** serves as the home page and must include links to the files for **Zhang San** and **Li Si**. After this, every time these three terms appear in each subsequent chapter, a clickable link is automatically generated, counting as one citation.
2. Then Author B sees A's story, finds it interesting, and decides to participate. He creates the character **Wang Wu** and asks A to add the link to **Wang Wu**'s file in the **Xuanyuan Dynasty** file. Then he writes **Wang Wu**'s biography, but doesn't finish it, and A also uses the character **Wang Wu** in his subsequent works.
3. Next, Author C, seeing the unfinished story of **Wang Wu**, helps write an ending for him.
4. While Author D, thinking C's ending is not good, writes another version, which unexpectedly receives a lot of likes, attracting a film company to buy the copyright.
5. Since Author C is not involved in this story path, the council members are composed of **A, B, and D**, who negotiate how to set the allocation of the **2 weights**.
6. Assume in the whole work, **Xuanyuan Dynasty** is cited 100 times, has a word count of 5000 words, and 800 likes. **Zhang San** and **Li Si** are each cited 10 times, have 2500 words, and 100 likes. **Wang Wu** is cited 50 times, has 100,000 words, and 500 likes. The ending written by D is not cited, has 20,000 words, but has 5000 likes.
7. Then A definitely hopes the **Citation Weight** is high, while B and D hope the **Word Count Weight** is high.
8. Thus, the three negotiate and decide: **Citation Weight** 40%, **Word Count Weight** 60%.
9. The copyright sells for 1,000,000:
- A's score is:
	**Xuanyuan Dynasty** $((100/160) * 40\% + (0.5/13) * 60\%) * (800/6500) = 0.0336094674556213$
    
	**Zhang San** $((10/160) * 40\% + (0.25/13) * 60\%) * (100/6500) = 0.0005621301775147929$
    
	**Li Si** $((10/160) * 40\% + (0.25/13) * 60\%) * (100/6500) = 0.0005621301775147929$
- B's score is: $((50/160) * 40\% + (10/13) * 60\%) * (500/6500) = 0.0451183431952663$
- D's score is: $((0/160) * 40\% + (2/13) * 60\%) * (5000/6500) = 0.0710059171597633$
- Total score: $0.1508579881656805$
10. Final distribution:
- A = $(0.0336094674556213+0.0005621301775147929*2) / 0.1508579881656805 * 1,000,000 = 230,241.22$
- B = $0.0451183431952663 / 0.1508579881656805 * 1,000,000 = 299,078.25$
- C = $0.0710059171597633 / 0.1508579881656805 * 1,000,000 = 470,680.52$
11. Subsequently, the IP is noticed by a game company that wants to develop an open-world game using all the story content. In this case, C will also share the revenue, and the calculation formula is the same as above.

### 4.2 Content Island
1. Assume Author B writes a side story after reading Author A's story, but his request to A to submit a link is rejected. This article then belongs to a content island, and other users of the creation platform cannot discover his work, nor is it included in the calculation of the overall IP value.
2. However, since he can share the link to his article with friends through other channels, assume Author C writes another article based on B's work and cites B's article. Subsequently, C's article is cited by an author already connected to the main network, and thus B's article is indirectly connected to the main network, thereby generating IP value.

### 4.3 Split Personality
1. Assume both Author A and Author B created a character named **Zhang San**, saved in their respective directories. If Author C has only read B's article, when citing **Zhang San** in subsequent creations, it naturally refers to the Zhang San created by B.
2. Author D has read both A's and B's articles. When he mentions **Zhang San** in his article, a situation of split personality occurs. He must choose a personality he deems appropriate to cite. Of course, he can also create a new **Zhang San** himself. All these **Zhang Sans** coexist in this multiverse.
3. Author E reads all three of their articles, finds it interesting, and also writes an article, linking all three **Zhang Sans** together, thus intersecting the forked worlds again.

### 4.4 Content Completion
1. Assume Author A wrote an article and mentioned a minor character (passerby), but did not create a character definition file for him. Author B reads his story, finds this passerby interesting, and writes a character definition article for him. After sending a link request to A and A agreeing, B's supplementary content is incorporated into the entire network, and subsequent authors mentioning the passerby naturally cite B's article.
2. In another scenario, A has a logical flaw in his creation. B discovers it, writes an article to fill the gap, and informs A. A includes B's content in the revised edition and links to B's original text, expressing gratitude. In the future calculation of word count, citation count, and net likes, B's contribution will be included.

### 4.5 Plagiarism Judgment
It is very difficult to determine if the content of an article constitutes plagiarism. This system relies entirely on the community's market mechanism and external legal procedures for judgment and punishment.

1. Market Punishment (Community Autonomy):

Evidence and Publicity: The victim or reader is responsible for providing concrete evidence and presenting it to the community to prove that the majority of an article (or file) is plagiarized.

Punishment Mechanism: The community's only punishment for plagiarized content is market choice: expressing disapproval through a large number of "dislikes." This will directly result in the file's net like value being negative, the contribution score being zero, and the content being automatically excluded from the adopted path during commercialization.

2. Legal Responsibility and Removal:

Legal Action: Legal actions involving copyright and plagiarism rely entirely on the aggrieved party to resolve through external enforcement agencies and legal procedures.

Council Responsibility: The council has no authority to forcibly remove content but has the right to remove the work's link on the DIPCP. Upon receiving a legally binding ruling (such as a court injunction), the council will notify all authors and permanently exclude the file and the path it belongs to from the commercialization path decision.

3. Citation Norms:

Exception for Copying: Assume Author A has detailed the appearance, personality, and other characteristics of Zhang San in Zhang San's file, and Author B, in a "Biography of Zhang San" due to plot necessity, directly copies part or all of the content. As long as a link of appreciation is added, as in 4.4.2, this situation is not considered plagiarism but is regarded as a high-value citation of the source content, which will bring the cited party (A) a gain in **"Citation Count"** score.
